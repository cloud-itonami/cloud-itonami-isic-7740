(ns ipleaseops.governor
  "IPLeaseGovernor -- the independent compliance layer that earns the
  IPLeaseAdvisor the right to commit. The advisor has no notion of
  whether an IP-portfolio/license-agreement record is actually
  registered and verified, whether its own proposed `:effect` secretly
  claims a direct actuation instead of a mere proposal, or whether it
  has silently drifted into a permanently out-of-scope decision area,
  so this MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and
  fall back to HOLD.

  This actor's scope is deliberately narrow -- IP-LEASING OPERATIONS
  COORDINATION ONLY (license-record logging, license-compliance-review
  scheduling proposals, infringement/misuse-concern flagging, royalty-
  report/payment-tracking coordination), for patents, trademarks, and
  franchise rights (NOT copyrighted works, which are covered by
  different ISIC classes). It NEVER performs or authorizes:
    - finalizing a licensing grant (who is licensed to practice a
      patent, use a trademark, or operate a franchise, under what
      terms)
    - finalizing a royalty-rate determination (locking in what rate a
      licensee actually pays)

  Both of those are ALWAYS either a hard permanent block (this
  governor) or an always-escalate op (`:flag-infringement-concern`) --
  NEVER an auto-commit-eligible op in any phase. This actor coordinates
  the back office around those decisions; it never makes them.

  Three HARD checks, ALL permanent, un-overridable by any human approval:

    1. License record unverified -- the target IP-portfolio/license-
                                      agreement record must exist AND
                                      be independently confirmed
                                      `:registered?`/`:verified?` in
                                      the store before ANY proposal for
                                      it may commit or even escalate.
                                      Never trusts a proposal's own
                                      claim about the record --
                                      re-derived from the record's own
                                      store record, the same 'ground
                                      truth, not self-report'
                                      discipline every sibling actor's
                                      governor uses.
    2. Effect not :propose       -- every proposal's `:effect` MUST
                                     be `:propose`. Any other effect
                                     value is, by construction, a
                                     claim to directly actuate/commit
                                     outside governance -- HARD block,
                                     not merely low-confidence.
    3. Scope exclusion           -- ANY proposal (regardless of op)
                                     whose op, rationale, summary,
                                     citations or draft value touches
                                     the ACT of finalizing a licensing
                                     grant, or the ACT of finalizing a
                                     royalty-rate determination, is a
                                     HARD, PERMANENT block -- this
                                     actor's charter excludes that
                                     territory structurally, not as a
                                     rollout milestone. Evaluated
                                     UNCONDITIONALLY on every
                                     proposal. An op outside the closed
                                     four-op allowlist is the SAME
                                     failure mode (an advisor proposing
                                     something it was never authorized
                                     to propose) and is folded into
                                     this same check.

  IMPORTANT (self-trip discipline): `scope-excluded-terms` below are
  phrased as the FINALIZATION/EXECUTION ACTION ('finalize the licensing
  grant', 'set the royalty rate'), never as a bare noun ('license',
  'licensing', 'royalty', 'rate'). This actor's own legitimate
  happy-path proposals -- especially `:flag-infringement-concern`,
  whose entire purpose is to talk ABOUT licensing/royalty concerns --
  routinely use those bare nouns in their default rationale text. A
  bare-noun term list would self-trip the actor on its own default
  mock-advisor proposals; `governor-test` and `governor-contract-test`
  both assert this never happens.

  One ESCALATE (SOFT) gate: LLM confidence below the floor, OR the op
  is `:flag-infringement-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates to a human,
  regardless of confidence, regardless of how clean the proposal
  otherwise is. `ipleaseops.phase` independently agrees:
  `:flag-infringement-concern` is never a member of any phase's `:auto`
  set either -- two layers, not one."
